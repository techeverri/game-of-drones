# Rock, Paper, Scissors

> In Rock, Paper, Scissors there are two players trying to conquer each other.

## Getting Started

To get you started you can simply clone the repository and install the dependencies:

### Prerequisites

You need git to clone the repository. You can get git from http://git-scm.com/.

We also use a number of Node.js tools to initialize and run rock-paper-scissors. You must have Node.js and its package manager (npm) installed. You can get them from http://nodejs.org/.

### Clone

Clone the rock-paper-scissors repository using git:

    git clone https://github.com/techeverri/rock-paper-scissors.git
    cd rock-paper-scissors

### Install Dependencies

We have two kinds of dependencies in this project: tools and angular framework code. The tools help us manage and test the application.

We get the tools we depend upon and the angular code via npm, the node package manager.

    npm install

You should find that you have a new folder in your project.

* node_modules - contains the npm packages for the tools we need

### Run the Application

We have preconfigured the project with a simple development web server. The simplest way to start this server is:

    npm start

Now browse to the app at http://localhost:8080/.
